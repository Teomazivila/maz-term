# DevOps Terminal Dashboard - Execution Plan

## Project Timeline
| Phase | Duration | Deliverables |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Setup | 2 days | Repository, build system, dependencies |
| Core UI | 4 days | Base UI framework, navigation, layouts |
| MVP Integrations | 5 days | Local metrics, HTTP checks, Git status |
| Testing & MVP Release | 3 days | MVP binary release |
| Extended Integrations | 10 days | Cloud, CI/CD, K8s integrations |
| Optimization & Polish | 5 days | Performance, UI refinements |
| Final Release | 1 day | v1.0 release with documentation |

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Setup (2 days)
- [x] Initialize Git repository with README, LICENSE
- [x] Set up Go modules and dependencies
- [x] Configure build system (Makefile)
- [x] Create directory structure
- [x] Set up testing framework

### Phase 2: Core UI Framework (4 days)
- [ ] Implement base TUI application using BubbleTea
- [ ] Create layout manager for dashboard components
- [ ] Implement tab navigation system
- [ ] Design status bar component

- [ ] Add keyboard shortcut system
- [ ] Create color theme system

### Phase 3: MVP Integrations (5 days)
- [ ] Local system metrics collector
  - [ ] CPU usage monitor
  - [ ] Memory usage monitor
  - [ ] Disk usage monitor
  - [ ] Network stats monitor
- [ ] HTTP endpoint health checker
  - [ ] Configurable endpoint list
  - [ ] Response time tracking
  - [ ] Status visualization
- [ ] Git repository status
  - [ ] Branch information
  - [ ] Modified files tracking
  - [ ] Commit history

### Phase 4: Testing & MVP Release (3 days)
- [ ] Unit tests for core components
- [ ] Integration tests for data collectors
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Bug fixes and refinements
- [ ] Documentation for MVP features
- [ ] Package MVP release

### Phase 5: Extended Integrations (10 days)
- [ ] Cloud provider integration
- [ ] CI/CD system integration
- [ ] Kubernetes integration
- [ ] Notification system

### Phase 6: Optimization & Polish (5 days)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Enhanced visualization components
- [ ] Plugin system for extensibility
- [ ] Export and sharing features

### Development Approach

#### Tools & Libraries
- Go 1.21+
- UI: BubbleTea/Lipgloss
- Data storage: SQLite
- Configuration: Viper
- Testing: Testify
- Build: Make

#### Implementation Strategy
- Component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Interface-driven design for plugin system
- Iterative development with daily working builds

## Risk Management

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| API rate limiting | Medium | Implement caching, configurable polling intervals |
| Terminal compatibility issues | High | Test across multiple terminals, use compatible UI libraries |
| Authentication token security | High | Use environment variables, secure local storage |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Regular profiling, benchmark testing |

## Documentation Plan
- README with installation and usage instructions
- Configuration guide with examples
- Architecture overview
- API documentation for plugin developers
