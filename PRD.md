# DevOps Terminal Dashboard - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Overview

A terminal-based dashboard that aggregates key DevOps metrics, alerts, and tasks in one centralized interface. The product provides real-time monitoring capabilities with an efficient, highly customizable UI built for terminal environments.

### 1.1 Objectives
- Improve visibility into DevOps infrastructure and processes
- Reduce context switching between different monitoring tools
- Provide at-a-glance status updates for critical systems
- Enable faster response to operational incidents

### 1.2 Target Users
- DevOps Engineers
- SRE Professionals
- Backend Developers
- Infrastructure Team Leads

## 2. User Requirements

### 2.1 Core Features
- **System Monitoring**: CPU, memory, disk usage stats for local and remote systems
- **Service Status**: Health checks for critical services and endpoints
- **CI/CD Pipeline Status**: Build and deployment status from common CI systems
- **Infrastructure Overview**: Cloud resource utilization and status
- **Kubernetes Monitor**: Pod health, resource utilization, and deployment status
- **Notification Center**: Critical alerts and pending action items
- **Command Palette**: Quick actions and predefined scripts

### 2.2 User Stories

#### As a DevOps Engineer:
- I want to see all critical metrics in one interface so I can quickly identify issues
- I want to receive notifications about anomalous system behavior so I can respond before outages
- I want to track deployment status so I can ensure releases are proceeding as expected
- I want to execute common tasks directly from the dashboard so I can respond quickly

#### As a Team Lead:
- I want to customize dashboards for different projects so team members see relevant information
- I want to define alert thresholds so we respond to actual issues, not noise
- I want to track historical performance so we can identify improvement areas
